Hanzi Practice Sheet
====================

Requirements
------------
This practice sheet is a TeX document for the ConTeXt Mark IV typesetting
engine.

In order to compile it to a PDF file you need to have a
[ConTeXt][1] installation and to use it in [Mark IV][2] which is
still beta and therefore needs to be used explicitly.

For correct representation of the Chinese Hanzi you will also need to install a
suitable TrueType font containing these characters.
The example font used by default in this sheet is STKaiti which could be
acquired using a web search engine if you have not installed it in your system.

Font [installation][3] can be done by using the command line interface.


Usage
-----
To use this practice sheet you can provide your own [Anki][4]
export file and point to it by exchanging the file name used in the bottom of
the TeX document.

An export example is included in this repository in the file *zhongwen.txt*.
